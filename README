Goal:

A simple python script that can parse the postgres log and produce a
meaningful summary.

Requirements:

  Python 2.5+

Some details:

  The log summarizer group messages into the following categories:

   - Unknown    representing log entries that this script does not
                recognize

   - Fatal      postgres FATAL event

   - Error      postgres ERROR event (typically followed by a CONTEXT
                and/or a STATEMENT)

   - Warning    postgres WARNING event

   - Log        misc. postgres LOG event

  The script tried to group CONTEXT, STATEMENT, and DETAIL event with
  their corresponding event.  This is done by remembering the last
  event that is recorded to the same IP.

  For the log event, the script also digest the following events:

   - checkpoint complete

   - automatic analyze of table

   - automatic vacuum of table

   - slow query
